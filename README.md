### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Canadian software engineer living & working London Ontario ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Iâ€™ve spent most of my career building big things in small boxes. Iâ€™ve used an eclectic mix of languages along the way. Iâ€™m currently aspiring to build a stable of side projects while working full-time and raising a family.
